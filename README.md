# Rec-Reserve

The Rec-Reserve app is an all-in-one resource for Recreation Centers to connect with their customers. Patrons can reserve courts and equipment, claim spots in classes, and plan out their rec center visits. The idea is to streamline the old reservation systems currently used in rec centers. Future versions of this app will also contain online ordering for concessions and various other features as needed.
